<h2>The modulo hash</h2>
<p>Let's suppose you want to calculate the hashes of the numbers 1, 5, 9, 18, 27 using the modulo: <span class="math-tex">\(h(x) = x\ \%\ p\)</span>. You also want the hash values to be as uniform as possible, i.e. as few giving the same value as possible. Which would be the best choice of <span class="math-tex">\(p\)</span> for this?</p>
