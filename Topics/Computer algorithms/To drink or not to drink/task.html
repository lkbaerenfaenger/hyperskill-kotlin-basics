<p>Hamlet had a magic kettle that could infinitely brew coffee following the algorithm. The algorithm of the kettle is pretty simple:</p>
<pre><code class="java">ADD water, coffee beans, and sugar
WHILE there is water, coffee beans, and sugar:
    make coffee</code></pre>
<p>In what cases could this kettle not make coffee? </p></body></html>
