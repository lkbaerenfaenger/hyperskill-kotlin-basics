<h2>Hexadecimal numbers</h2>
<html><body><p>Anyone who spends enough time with a computer or other digital device will likely come across mysterious records consisting of numbers and Latin letters, such as <span class="math-tex">\(10FEF\)</span>. For people not familiar with it, they may seem like some cipher. What is behind these symbols? It turns out that these are simply numbers in<strong> HEX</strong> (<strong>Hexadecimal Number System</strong>). HEX is an alternative way to represent numbers.</p>
<p>HEX can also be written in lowercase (hex, an example of usage: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Wikipedia article</a>), but in this topic, we, for consistency, will use only uppercase HEX or, simply, hexadecimal. </p>
<h5 id="why-hex-a-decimal" style="text-align: center;">Why HEX-a-decimal?</h5>
<p>For years before the invention of computers, people used the <strong>decimal (base-<span class="math-tex">\(10\)</span>)</strong> system for counting – because it's convenient when you have <span class="math-tex">\(10\)</span> fingers and <strong><span class="math-tex">\(10\)</span></strong> toes.</p>
<p>In computers, however, there are only two options: on and off, which created the idea of a <strong>binary digit</strong> or <strong>bit</strong>, for short.</p>
<p>For convenience, computer engineers tended to group bits. In the 1960s, they could group <span class="math-tex">\(3\)</span> bits at a time: a group of <span class="math-tex">\(3\)</span> bits is base <span class="math-tex">\(2\cdot2\cdot2=\)</span> base-<strong><span class="math-tex">\(8\)</span></strong> number.</p>
<p>As computers got more powerful, people learned to cluster bits by <span class="math-tex">\(4\)</span> instead of <span class="math-tex">\(3\)</span>. A group of <span class="math-tex">\(4\)</span> bits, written as one symbol, can have <span class="math-tex">\(16\)</span> values instead of <span class="math-tex">\(8\)</span> – in other words, two times more than a group of <span class="math-tex">\(3\)</span> bits. So, this system is more compact than decimal, <strong>octal</strong> (base-<strong><span class="math-tex">\(8\)</span></strong>), and binary systems!</p>
<p></p><div class="alert alert-primary">The only thing missing – a name for the new excellent number system.

<p>A single number can have <span class="math-tex">\(16\)</span> values. <span class="math-tex">\(16=10+6\)</span></p>
<p>Hex (from Greek) means <span class="math-tex">\(6\)</span>, and decimal (from Latin, but that's OK) means <span class="math-tex">\(10\)</span> (also, we are already used to the decimal number system and the word <em>decimal</em>). So... <strong>HEX-a-decimal</strong> looks like the perfect name!</p></div>
<h5 id="hexadecimal-digits" style="text-align: center;">Hexadecimal digits</h5>
<p>The hexadecimal number system uses numbers <span class="math-tex">\(0,1\dots9\)</span> and the first six Latin letters: <span class="math-tex">\(A, B, C, D, E, F\)</span> (corresponding to decimals <span class="math-tex">\(10,11\dots15\)</span>), as <strong>hexadecimal digits</strong>.</p>
<p>Yes, in some numeral systems, digits can be letters, too!</p>
<p>The table below compares how numbers <span class="math-tex">\(0,1\dots15\)</span> are written in the binary, the decimal, and the HEX number systems:</p>

<p>So, as you see, we start using letters when we run out of digits in HEX. How is the decimal number <span class="math-tex">\(16\)</span> represented in HEX? The answer is <span class="math-tex">\(10\)</span>!</p>
<p></p><div class="alert alert-primary">It's better to write numbers with their base as a lower index, so you don't confuse decimal <span class="math-tex">\(10\)</span> with hexadecimal <span class="math-tex">\(10\)</span>: <span class="math-tex">\(10_{16}\)</span>
<p>You might have already noticed those lower indices in the table above. Other ways to avoid confusion include writing a HEX number with <code class="java">h</code> after it or <code class="java">0x</code> before it. For instance, <code class="java">63h</code>, <code class="java">0x63</code> and <span class="math-tex">\(63_{16}\)</span> are three different ways to indicate that <span class="math-tex">\(63\)</span> is a hexadecimal number.</p></div>
<h5 id="binary-to-hex-and-vice-versa" style="text-align: center;">Binary to HEX and vice versa</h5>
<p>HEX is widely used in computer science because we can easily translate binary numbers into HEX. Moreover, HEX is a simplified way to represent binary numbers.</p>
<p>Remember: <span class="math-tex">\(16\)</span> is <span class="math-tex">\(2^4\)</span>. That means we can split (starting from the right, or, in other words, from the end) any binary number into a sequence of <span class="math-tex">\(4\)</span>-digit binary numbers. These numbers are then mapped to HEX digits using the table above.</p>
<p>Let's try converting the number <span class="math-tex">\(1110011001110001_2\)</span> to HEX:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span class="math-tex">\[1110011001110001_2 = 1110\ 0110\ 0111\ 0001_2 = E671_{16}\]</span></p>
<p>Of course, everything is not as simple as it seems. If the length of our binary number is not divisible by <span class="math-tex">\(4\)</span> without remainder, then the leftmost number of our sequence will contain less than <span class="math-tex">\(4\)</span> digits:</p>
<p><span class="math-tex">\[101100_2 = 10\ 1100_2 =\ ???_{16}\]</span></p>
<p></p><div class="alert alert-primary">Did you notice that in a decimal system, adding any numbers of zeroes to the left of a decimal number (leading zeroes) doesn't change the number's value? <span class="math-tex">\(42=042=000042=000\dots00042\)</span>, and so on. Well, not only the decimal number system that works like that:

<p>In any base-n (n &gt; 1) number system, adding any number of leading zeroes to the number does not change its value. Those zeroes are even called <strong>non-significant zeroes.</strong></p></div>
<p>How can it help us? Remember that <span class="math-tex">\(10_2=0010_2\)</span>, and, therefore:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span class="math-tex">\[101100_2 = 10\ 1100_2 =2C_{16}\]</span></p>
<p>So, if the leftmost number in our split-sequence of <span class="math-tex">\(4\)</span>-digit binary numbers contains less than <span class="math-tex">\(4\)</span> digits, we add leading zeroes to it until it is a <span class="math-tex">\(4\)</span>-digit binary number and then match it, along with the rest in the sequence, to the corresponding HEX digit using the table. The resulting sequence is ready to be mapped to HEX digits using the table above.</p>
<p>Converting a hexadecimal number into a binary is even easier. Each HEX digit corresponds to the <span class="math-tex">\(4\)</span>-digit binary sequence. All you have to do is map digits to sequences with the table.</p>
<p><span class="math-tex">\[BE_{16} = 1011\ 1110_2 = 10111110_2\]</span></p>
<p>If you need to convert a number from decimal to hexadecimal, you must divide it by <span class="math-tex">\(16\)</span> multiple times during the calculation. The binary to hexadecimal conversion method is computationally simple, and dividing by <span class="math-tex">\(2\)</span> is easier than dividing by <span class="math-tex">\(16\)</span>. Therefore, it is reasonable to convert in two steps using the conversion to binary number. Thus, to convert a number from decimal to hexadecimal, convert the decimal number to binary and then the resulting binary number to hexadecimal using the method above. For example, we reverse the number <span class="math-tex">\(44\)</span> to binary and get <span class="math-tex">\(101100_2\)</span>, and then convert <span class="math-tex">\(101100_2\)</span> to hexadecimal and get <span class="math-tex">\(2C_{16}\)</span>. To convert back from hexadecimal to decimal<strong>,</strong> use the same idea. To do that, convert the hexadecimal number to binary and the resulting number to decimal. </p>
<h5 id="applications-of-hex" style="text-align: center;">Applications of HEX</h5>
<p>We use the hexadecimal system to store error codes during the work of various software products. For example, operating system errors are encoded in this way. If you decode your error code, you'll find out the exact error that occurred. Besides, in URLs, <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_urlencode.ASP" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">character codes</a> are written as hexadecimal pairs prefixed with <code class="java">%</code>. You can see for yourself by googling a symbol <code class="java">@</code>. The link in the address bar of your browser would look like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">https://www.google.com/search?q=%40</code></pre>
<p>The HEX numbers are also used for writing programs in low-level languages and in some encodings. For example, Unicode (a computer standard for symbol encoding) represents every symbol as a hexadecimal number. HEX numbers encode even color schemes. Thus, in <strong><span style="color: #ff4363;">R</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">G</span><span style="color: #64b0f4;">B</span></strong> encoding, every color can be defined as <span class="math-tex">\(3\)</span> hexadecimal numbers, each for <span style="color: #ff4363;"><strong>R</strong>ed</span>, <span style="color: #66cc66;"><strong>G</strong>reen</span>, or <span style="color: #64b0f4;"><strong>B</strong>lue</span> color components, respectively.</p>
<h5 id="conclusion" style="text-align: center;">Conclusion</h5>
<p>As you can see, there're many ways to use HEX. In this topic, we have covered that:</p>
<ul>
<li>A HEX number is basically a <span class="math-tex">\(4\)</span>-bit group with <span class="math-tex">\(16\)</span> values that can include numbers from <span class="math-tex">\(0\)</span> to <span class="math-tex">\(9\)</span> and <span class="math-tex">\(A, B, C, D, E, F\)</span> as hex-digits;</li>
<li>Converting a HEX number into a binary requires splitting into a sequence of <span class="math-tex">\(4\)</span>-digit binary numbers;</li>
<li>In the real world, the application of HEX numbers is vast — from error codes to symbol encoding.</li>
</ul>
<p>We hope that this information will be helpful to you in the future. But for now, let's turn to practice!</p></body></html>
