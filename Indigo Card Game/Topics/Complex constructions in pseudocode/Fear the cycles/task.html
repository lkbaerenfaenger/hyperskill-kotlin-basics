<p>One of the key skills in programming is to read other people's code. Read the following lines and try to guess what the program will print:</p>
<pre><code class="java">function fun(lol):
    k = 1000
    while k &gt; 0:
        lol = lol * 2
        k = k - 1

for i in [1, 3]:
    //print(i)

c = 4
print(c)
</code></pre>
<p>Note: Print every number on a new line.</p></body></html>
