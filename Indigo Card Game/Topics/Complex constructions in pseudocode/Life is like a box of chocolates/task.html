<h2>Life is like a box of chocolates</h2>
<html><body>
<p>Forest loves candy and math very much. Therefore, he decided to eat sweets according to a certain formula <span class="math-tex">\((i + j) \bmod k = 1\)</span>, where <span class="math-tex">\(i\)</span> is the row number and <span class="math-tex">\(j\)</span> is the column number. Which candies will remain in a square box of size <span class="math-tex">\(n \times n\)</span> when he eats all the candies according to the formula?</p>
<pre><code class="java">function reggae(n, k):
    for i in [1, n]:
        for j in [1, n]:
            if (i + j) mod k == 1 then
                print("*")
            else:
                print("o")
        println()                 //new line</code></pre>
<p> In other words, what will the program output when calling the function with the arguments <span class="math-tex">\(n = 5\)</span> and <span class="math-tex">\(k=2\)</span>?</p></body></html>
