<h2>A library</h2>
<p>Create a JSON object that represents a library.</p>

<p>A library has only a single <code class="java">books</code> field, but each book has exactly two fields: <code class="java">title</code> and <code class="java">author</code>. Assign information about books you've read to these fields.</p>

<p>Fill the library with <u>at least three books</u> and enter the resulting JSON.</p>

<p><div class="alert alert-primary">You should end up with nested objects. Look at section 2 in theory to remember their syntax.<br>
You can check if the JSON you wrote is valid at https://jsonlint.com/<br>
</div></p>
