<h2>Try-with-resources</h2>
<p>We have already mentioned that <strong>input streams</strong> should be closed after they have been used. Let's discuss what happens when you're working with outside resources: how closing can be performed and why it is important.</p>
<h5 id="why-close">Why close?</h5>
<p>When an<strong> </strong>input stream is created, the JVM notifies the OS about its intention to work with a file. If the JVM process has enough permissions and everything is fine, the OS returns a <strong>file descriptor</strong> — a special indicator used by a process to access the file. The problem is that the number of file descriptors is limited. This is the reason why it is important to notify the OS that the job is done and the file descriptor that is held can be released for further reuse. In previous examples, we invoked the method <code class="language-kotlin">close</code> for this purpose. Once it is called, the JVM releases all system resources associated with the stream.</p>
<h5 id="pitfalls">Pitfalls</h5>
<p>Resource releasing works if the JVM calls the <code class="language-kotlin">close</code> method, but it is possible that the method will not be called at all.</p>
<p>Look at the example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">val reader: Reader = FileReader("file.txt")
// code which may throw an exception
reader.close()</code></pre>
<p>Suppose something goes wrong before the <code class="language-kotlin">close</code> invocation and an exception is thrown. It leads to a situation in which the method will never be called and system resources won't be released. It is possible to solve the problem by using the <strong>try-catch-finally</strong> construction:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">var reader: Reader? = null
try {
    reader = FileReader("file.txt")
    // code which may throw an exception
} finally {
    reader!!.close()
}</code></pre>
<p>In this and the following examples, we assume that <code class="language-kotlin">file.txt</code> exists and do not check the instance of <code class="language-kotlin">Reader</code> for <code class="language-kotlin">null</code> in the <code class="language-kotlin">finally</code> block. We do it to keep the code snippet as simple as possible, but it is not safe in the case of a real application.</p>
<p>Thrown exceptions cannot affect the invocation of the <code class="language-kotlin">close</code> method now.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this solution still has some problems. That is, the <code class="language-kotlin">close</code> method can potentially raise exceptions itself. Suppose there are two exceptions: the first was raised inside the <code class="language-kotlin">try</code><em> </em>section, and the second was thrown by the <code class="language-kotlin">finally</code><em> </em>section. It leads to the loss of the first exception. Let's see why this happens:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">@Throws(IOException::class)
fun readFile() {
    var reader: Reader? = null
    try {
        reader = FileReader("file.txt")
        throw RuntimeException("Exception1")
    } finally {
        reader?.close() // throws new RuntimeException("Exception2")
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>First, the <code class="language-kotlin">try</code><em> </em>block throws an exception. As we know, the <code class="language-kotlin">finally</code> block is invoked anyway. Next, in our example, the <code class="language-kotlin">close</code> method throws an exception. When two exceptions occur, which one is thrown outside the method? It will be the latter one: <code class="language-kotlin">Exception2</code> in our case. It means we will never know that the <code class="language-kotlin">try</code><em> </em>block raised an exception at all.</p>
<p>Let's try to reason and fix this. Ok, we don't want to lose the first exception, so we upgrade the code a little bit and handle <code class="language-kotlin">Exception2</code> right after it was thrown:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">@Throws(IOException::class)
fun readFile() {
    var reader: Reader? = null
    try {
        reader = FileReader("file.txt")
        throw RuntimeException("Exception1")
    } finally {
        try {
            reader!!.close() // throws new RuntimeException("Exception2")
        } catch (e: Exception) {
            // handle Exception2
        }
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>Now, the piece of code throws <code class="language-kotlin">Exception1</code> outside. It may be correct, but we still do not save information on both exceptions, and sometimes we don't want to lose it. So now, let's see how we can handle this situation nicely.</p>
<h5 id="solution">Solution</h5>
<p>A simple and reliable way called <strong>try-with-resources</strong> was introduced in Java 7. In Kotlin, there is no implementation of try-with-resources, but we can apply the <code class="language-kotlin">use</code> extension method:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">FileReader("file.txt").use {
    reader -&gt;
    // some code
}</code></pre>
<p>Example in Java:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">try (Reader reader = new FileReader("file.txt")) {
    // some code
}</code></pre>
<p>It is possible to create several objects as well. The code below is also fine:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">FileReader("file1.txt").use { reader1 -&gt;
    FileReader("file2.txt").use { reader2 -&gt;
        // some code
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>The second part just contains some code for dealing with the object created in the first part.</p>
<p>As you see, there are no explicit calls of the <code class="language-kotlin">close</code> method at all. It is implicitly invoked for all objects declared in the first part. The construction guarantees closing all resources in a proper way.</p>
<p>You can initialize the input stream outside the design and then utilize the <code class="language-kotlin">use</code> method:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">val reader: Reader = FileReader("file.txt")
reader.use {
    // some code
}</code></pre>
<p></p><div class="alert alert-primary">Surely, we do our best to write error-free programs. However, it is difficult to foresee all possible problems. The best practice is to place any code concerning system resources in the <code class="language-kotlin">use</code> method.</div>
<h5 id="closeable-resources">Closeable resources</h5>
<p>We have dealt with a file input stream to demonstrate how try-with-resources is used. However, not only the resources based on files should be released. Closing is also crucial for other outside sources, like web or database connections. Classes that handle them have a <code class="language-kotlin">close</code> method and, therefore, can be wrapped by the try-with-resources statement.</p>
<p>For example, let's consider <code class="language-kotlin">java.util.Scanner</code>. Earlier, we used <code class="language-kotlin">Scanner</code> for reading data from the standard input, but it can read data from a file as well. <code class="language-kotlin">Scanner</code> has a <code class="language-kotlin">close</code> method for releasing outside sources.</p>
<p>Let's consider an example of a program that reads two integers separated by a space from a file and prints them:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">Scanner(File("file.txt")).use { scanner -&gt;
    val first: Int = scanner.nextInt()
    val second: Int = scanner.nextInt()
    println("arguments: $first $second")
}</code></pre>
<p>Suppose something went wrong and the file content is <code class="language-kotlin">123 not_number</code>, where the second argument is a <code class="language-kotlin">String</code>. It leads to a <code class="language-kotlin">java.util.InputMismatchException</code> while parsing the second argument. The <code class="language-kotlin">use</code> method guarantees that file-related resources are released properly.</p>
<h5 id="whats-under-the-hood">What's under the hood?</h5>
<p>The <code class="language-kotlin">use</code> implementation looks like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">public inline fun &lt;T : Closeable?, R&gt; T.use(block: (T) -&gt; R): R {
    contract {
        callsInPlace(block, InvocationKind.EXACTLY_ONCE)
    }
    var exception: Throwable? = null
    try {
        return block(this)
    } catch (e: Throwable) {
        exception = e
        throw e
    } finally {
        when {
            apiVersionIsAtLeast(1, 1, 0) -&gt; this.closeFinally(exception)
            this == null -&gt; {}
            exception == null -&gt; close()
            else -&gt;
                try {
                    close()
                } catch (closeException: Throwable) {
                    // cause.addSuppressed(closeException) // ignored here
                }
        }
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>This function is defined as a generic extension on all <code class="language-kotlin">Closeable?</code> types. <code class="language-kotlin">Closeable</code> is Java's interface that uses try-with-resources.<br/>
The function takes a function literal block, which gets executed in <code class="language-kotlin">try</code>. Same as with try-with-resources in Java, <code class="language-kotlin">Closeable</code> gets closed in <code class="language-kotlin">finally</code>. Also, failures happening inside <code class="language-kotlin">block</code> lead to close executions, where possible exceptions are literally "suppressed" by just being ignored. This is different from try-with-resources because such exceptions can be requested in Java‘s solution. </p>
<p>If Kotlin didn't implement the <code class="language-kotlin">use</code> extension functions, we would need to write more code, take a look:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">import java.io.Closeable

fun main() {
    val resource = CustomCloseable()
    resource.use {
        println("I am an example of some code!")
        it.exampleMethod()
    }
    println("End of program!")
}

class CustomCloseable : Closeable {
    override fun close() {
        println("Close resource")
    }

    fun exampleMethod() {
        println("Example of some method for the CustomCloseable class")
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>And look at the output in the console: </p>
<p><img alt="" height="314" name="Снимок экрана от 2023-01-15 22-36-57.png" src="https://ucarecdn.com/0375dcf1-cf0d-42cc-aa00-3373822da27c/" width="1311"/></p>
<p>Let's analyze what is happening here:<br/>
- the <code class="language-kotlin">CustomCloseable</code> class implements a single <code class="language-kotlin">close()</code> method of the <code class="language-kotlin">Closeable</code> interface;<br/>
- in the <code class="language-kotlin">CustomCloseable</code> class, as an example, we added the <code class="language-kotlin">exampleMethod()</code> method, which prints the line <code class="language-kotlin">"Example of some method for the CustomCloseable class"</code>;</p>
<p>- in the <code class="language-kotlin">resource</code> object of the <code class="language-kotlin">CustomCloseable</code> class, we call the extension function <code class="language-kotlin">use</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">resource.use {
    println("I am an example of some code!")
    it.exampleMethod()
}</code></pre>
<p>In the console, we see a printed line <code class="language-kotlin">"Close resource"</code>; this line is printed when the <code class="language-kotlin">close()</code> method is called, but we did not call it in our code. This is the magic of using the extension function <code class="language-kotlin">use</code>, which under the hood implements a call to this function, which leads to the closure and release of the resources used. To fully understand what is happening, let's look at the interface code <code class="language-kotlin">Closeable</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">public interface Closeable extends AutoCloseable {

    public void close() throws IOException;
}</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, this interface expands the <code class="language-kotlin">AutoCloseable</code> interface. This is another interface that implements the <code class="language-kotlin">close()</code> method. To understand the difference between these interfaces, let's look at the <code class="language-kotlin">AutoCloseable</code> code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">public interface AutoCloseable {

    void close() throws Exception;
}</code></pre>
<p>The difference between these interfaces is that they generate different exceptions. <code class="language-kotlin">AutoCloseable</code> generates <code class="language-kotlin">Exception</code>, while <code class="language-kotlin">Closeable</code> generates <code class="language-kotlin">IOException</code>. Thus, we can say that <code class="language-kotlin">Closeable</code> can be used in the code where I/O errors may be thrown. <code class="language-kotlin">AutoCloseable</code> is more flexible and can be used in situations where different types of exceptions may occur.</p>
<h5 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h5>
<p>Inappropriate resource handling may lead to serious problems. Resources associated with files, the web, databases, or other outside sources should be released after use. Standard library classes dealing with outside sources have a <code class="language-kotlin">close</code> method for that purpose. Sometimes, releasing resources in a proper way may get complicated. Kotlin introduced the <code class="language-kotlin">use</code> method, which does all the work for you. Do not forget to use it when you're dealing with system resources.</p>
