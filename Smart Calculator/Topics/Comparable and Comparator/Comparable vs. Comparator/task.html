<h2>Comparable vs. Comparator</h2>
<p></p>
<p>For the personnel accounting system, we need to write a class that contains information about employees: their name, age, and salary.<br/>
Which interface should we implement if we know that we need to implement a simple salary sorting?</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">data class Employee(val name: String, val age: Int, val salary: Int): ???</code></pre>
