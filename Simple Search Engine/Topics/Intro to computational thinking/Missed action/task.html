<h2>Missed action</h2>
<p>A programmer wrote an algorithm for a smart refrigerator that buys missing products on its own.</p>

<p>The algorithm is described as follows:</p>

<ul>
	<li>check what products are unavailable</li>
	<li>make a shopping list</li>
	<li>inform the owner that the purchases are made</li>
</ul>

<p>However, the programmer forgot one important step in this algorithm. What is it?</p>
