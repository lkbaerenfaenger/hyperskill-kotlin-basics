<h2>Ann's mistake</h2>

<br/>
0 <span class="math-tex">\(\cdot\)</span> 1 + 1 <span class="math-tex">\(\cdot\)</span> 2 + 1 <span class="math-tex">\(\cdot\)</span> 4 + 1 <span class="math-tex">\(\cdot\)</span> 8 + 1 <span class="math-tex">\(\cdot\)</span> 16 + 0 <span class="math-tex">\(\cdot\)</span> 32 + 1 <span class="math-tex">\(\cdot\)</span> 64 = 94<br/>
