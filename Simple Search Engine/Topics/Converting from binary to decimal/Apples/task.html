<h2>Apples</h2>
<p>We are at the binary post office again.</p>

<p>The mail carrier decided to show you all the boxes that they've got at the moment. The first one can contain only one apple, the second – 2 apples, the third one – 4 apples, and so on.</p>

<p>How many apples can fit in the 8-th box?</p>

<p><button
        class="btn-sm btn-outline-secondary"
        onclick="getElementById('hint-293').style.display='inline'">
        Hint
      </button>
      <div id="hint-293" style="display:none;">Remember that when thinking about powers of 2, the first one is <span class="math-tex">\(2^0\)</span>!</div></p>
