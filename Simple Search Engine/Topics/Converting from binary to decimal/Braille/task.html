<h2>Braille</h2>
<html><body><p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braille" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Braille system</a> is a tactile writing system for people who lost their sight. Instead of letters and numbers, it uses <strong>braille cells</strong>.</p>
<p>Here is how <code class="java">hello world</code> looks in Braille:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" src="https://ucarecdn.com/8e4c3cae-074d-4d8a-8a9d-4535aca32aa9/"/></p>
<p>A whole braille cell consists of six dots arranged in two columns, each column having three dots. Each dot can be either raised (<strong>•</strong>) or not. Can you find the maximum number of braille cells in the system that can carry a meaning?</p>
<p>To solve this task, imagine that each dot in a single braille cell is a binary digit (it can have only one of two values – <strong>raised</strong> or <strong>not raised</strong>), and find the maximum binary digit that consists of six bits. Provide the answer in decimal.</p>
<p></p><div class="alert alert-warning"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braille_pattern_dots-0" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">A blank Braille cell</a> or <strong>no dots </strong>is not a meaningful symbol in Braille. Instead, it represents whitespace or the lack of content. Therefore, it doesn't count.</div></body></html>
