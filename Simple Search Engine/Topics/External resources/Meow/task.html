<h2>Meow!</h2>
<p>Usually, googling answers to your exercises is called cheating and is considered a bad thing. These exercises, however, are unique in that they specifically require you to google!</p>

<p>John has created a file “meow.txt”. When he uses the command <strong>cat</strong> on this file in UNIX terminal, like this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">$ cat meow.txt</code></pre>

<p>the output is:</p>

<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Meow meow meow! :3</code></pre>

<p>Tell us, what is <strong>inside</strong> this mysterious file? Write down <strong>the content of this file</strong> in one line.<br>
Don't write the command to extract the text, just write the text itself!</p>

<p><button
        class="btn-sm btn-outline-secondary"
        onclick="getElementById('hint-704').style.display='inline'">
        Hint
      </button>
      <div id="hint-704" style="display:none;">Google what command <strong>cat</strong> does. Or, if you have Linux/Mac OS, you can open the terminal (located at Applications/Utilities/Terminal) and print <strong>man cat </strong>(man is shortened for <strong>manual</strong>) to receive full information about this command.</div></p>
