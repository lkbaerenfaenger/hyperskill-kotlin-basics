<h2>The calculation result</h2>
<html><body><p>A programmer wrote a pseudocode program that takes three numbers A, B, and C as input, modifies each of them and returns the sum of the results:</p>
<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">BEGIN
    NUMBER A, B, C
    A = A * 2
    B = B + C
    C = A + B - 2
    RETURN A + B + C
END</code></pre>
<p>Then the programmer implemented the code and ran it. In the code, the programmer put a breakpoint on the line <code class="java">C = A + B - 2</code>.</p>
<p>What will be the values of the numbers A, B, C after stopping the program if their initial values were <code class="java">5</code>, <code class="java">7</code>, and <code class="java">9</code>, respectively?  </p></body></html>
