<h2>Which line should be stopped</h2>
<html><body><p>A programmer wrote the pseudocode for a function that takes two numbers as input, multiplies each of them by two, and returns the sum of the results.</p>
<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">BEGIN
    NUMBER A, B
    A = A * 2
    B = B ^ 2
    sum = A + B
    RETURN sum
END</code></pre>
<p>But there is going to be an error when the code is implemented and running. <strong>Which line should be stopped first</strong> to see that the execution result is incorrect?</p></body></html>
