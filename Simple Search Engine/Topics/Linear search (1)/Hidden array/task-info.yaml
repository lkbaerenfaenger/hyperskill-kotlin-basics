    <html>Correct! If the number from the first array is in the second array, then you will need to perform i comparison operations, where i is the position of this number in the second array.
    Every number that is not in the second array adds as many comparison operations as there are elements in the second array.
    Therefore, you can get the minimum number of operations from the minimum number of elements in the second array.</html>
