<h2>Binary arithmetic</h2>
<p>All computational operations in a computer are calculated in the binary numeral system by the processor. Therefore, operating with binary numbers is an important skill for programmers, circuit engineers and other people concerned. Programmers use binary calculations to speed up execution of programs, to work with hash tables, to process encoded information, to calculate addresses in computer memory, etc. Most often, in their work they have to deal with the operations of addition and subtraction.</p>
<h5 id="binary-addition">Binary addition</h5>
<p>Let's learn how to add binary numbers by hand. In fact, this information might not be new to you. Most likely, you already know the algorithm for adding numbers using the column addition method. It also applies to binary numbers. Let's take a closer look at how to do this.</p>
<p><u>1. Preparation</u></p>
<p>You need to determine which of the two numbers is the largest. Write down the larger number first, and then below it write the second number, aligning it to the right. Now draw a line below to record the answer under it. For example, let's try adding numbers <span class="math-tex">\(1011_2\)</span> and <span class="math-tex">\(111_2\)</span>. We will write them like this:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" height="246" name="2 — копия.jpg" src="https://ucarecdn.com/6584b704-4560-4fef-838c-44bb65233794/" width="268"/></p>
<p><u>2. Calculations</u></p>
<p>When writing a decimal number, we write the number of units at the first place from the right, the number of tens at the second place from the right, the number of hundreds at the third place from the right, and so on. For a binary number, the same holds true. But instead of tens we have twos, instead of hundreds we have fours and so on. Calculations start from units, moving from right to left. We can also pad the leading digits of numbers with zeros for convenience.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" height="224" name="2 — копия (2).jpg" src="https://ucarecdn.com/bc57645d-665b-4ae3-bcc7-221f03d1959c/" width="249"/></p>
<p>Use the following addition rules:</p>
<p><span class="math-tex">\(0+0=0 \\ 0+ 1 = 1 \\ 1+0 = 1 \\ 1+ 1= 10_2 \\\)</span></p>
<p>Note that <span class="math-tex">\(10_2\)</span> is <span class="math-tex">\(2\)</span> in decimal. As you can see, all addition rules are the same as for the decimal system. Now let's solve this example: <span class="math-tex">\(100_2 +10_2\)</span>. In the first place of both numbers are zeros, so we add <span class="math-tex">\(0\)</span> to <span class="math-tex">\(0\)</span>, which is <span class="math-tex">\(0\)</span>. We move on to the next place and add <span class="math-tex">\(0\)</span> to <span class="math-tex">\(1\)</span>, which is 1. Then we need to add <span class="math-tex">\(1\)</span> to <span class="math-tex">\(0\)</span>, which will be <span class="math-tex">\(1\)</span>. And the answer is <span class="math-tex">\(110_2\)</span>. You can see an illustration of this addition below:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" height="246" name="2.jpg" src="https://ucarecdn.com/efa991c4-78c1-4c33-8edc-4ceb4a20ba69/" width="562"/></p>
<p>Now let's solve another example: <span class="math-tex">\(101_2+1\)</span>. On the first step, we need to calculate <span class="math-tex">\(1+1\)</span>. According to the rules, we get <span class="math-tex">\(10_2\)</span>. But how to write this to the answer? We would do the same in the case of decimal numbers: we would carry <span class="math-tex">\(1\)</span> to the next digit. For example, <span class="math-tex">\(129 +1 = 130\)</span>. Solving using the column addition method, we would add <span class="math-tex">\(9\)</span> to <span class="math-tex">\(1\)</span>, which is <span class="math-tex">\(10\)</span>, and carry <span class="math-tex">\(1\)</span> to the next digit and get <span class="math-tex">\(130\)</span>. Why does this work? Let's represent <span class="math-tex">\(129\)</span> as the sum of <span class="math-tex">\(100 + 10 + 10+ 9\)</span> and group them by units, tens and hundreds, and add 1. Then it would look like this: <span class="math-tex">\((100) + (10 + 10) + (9 + 1)\)</span>. This is the same as <span class="math-tex">\((100)+ (10 +10 +10) +(0)\)</span>. We moved <span class="math-tex">\(10\)</span> inside the next brackets, to the numbers of the same order. The same holds true for binary numbers. Let's take a look at the example we considered above: <span class="math-tex">\(101_2 + 1\)</span>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" height="317" name="= 100 + + 10 + 10 + 0, копия (1) (1).gif" src="https://ucarecdn.com/b3c1722a-2d7d-4e0e-a356-358472f538f6/" width="564"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>When carrying, we write down <span class="math-tex">\(+1\)</span> above the next digit. </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" height="271" name="11010110.png" src="https://ucarecdn.com/7dfff7fe-c3b7-4b40-b37d-60a4f15f8cb4/" width="238"/></p>
<p>Let's try solve the example <span class="math-tex">\(1011_2+111_2\)</span>, now that we know all the rules. The first step is to add <span class="math-tex">\(1\)</span> to <span class="math-tex">\(1\)</span>and get <span class="math-tex">\(10_2\)</span>. Therefore, we transfer <span class="math-tex">\(1\)</span> to the next place.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" height="280" name="3 — копия (2).jpg" src="https://ucarecdn.com/ca1c3713-7552-4236-a72d-e123f8ac8cb4/" width="270"/></p>
<p>Then we need to solve <span class="math-tex">\(1+1\)</span> again, but from the previous step we've carried <span class="math-tex">\(1\)</span>, so we need to add <span class="math-tex">\(1+1+1 = 10_2 + 1= 11_2\)</span>. Therefore, we write down <span class="math-tex">\(1\)</span> at this place and carry <span class="math-tex">\(1\)</span> to the next place.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" height="301" name="dina_1.jpg" src="https://ucarecdn.com/d3774d5b-cb5e-4c92-8ed8-aed7a5601bb4/" width="330"/></p>
<p>Further, we are add <span class="math-tex">\(0+1\)</span>, but from the previous step we've carried <span class="math-tex">\(1\)</span>. Thus, we need to add <span class="math-tex">\(0 + 1 + 1 = 10_2\)</span>. Now we transfer <span class="math-tex">\(1\)</span> to the higher order digit again.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" height="272" name="dina_2.jpg" src="https://ucarecdn.com/53fee555-5d21-4ca0-a188-d1892116e4d5/" width="315"/></p>
<p>The last step is to sum <span class="math-tex">\(1+0\)</span>. We will get <span class="math-tex">\(1\)</span>, but we have carried <span class="math-tex">\(1\)</span> from the previous step. We get <span class="math-tex">\(10_2\)</span>, and since this is the highest order digit in the number, we just write <span class="math-tex">\(10_2\)</span>. Then the answer is <span class="math-tex">\(10010_2\)</span>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" height="273" name="dina_3.jpg" src="https://ucarecdn.com/cf733d9b-5678-47ba-b486-64a3b105b876/" width="357"/></p>
<p>We have received an answer <span class="math-tex">\(10010_2\)</span>. Let's check it. The decimal equivalent of <span class="math-tex">\({1011_2}\)</span> is 11 and the decimal equivalent of <span class="math-tex">\({111_2}\)</span> is 7. Therefore, the result is 18. The binary equivalent of 18 is <span class="math-tex">\(10010_2\)</span>. That's right!</p>
<p>Now try to solve an example <span class="math-tex">\(100011100_2 +111010_2\)</span> by yourself. The answer should be <span class="math-tex">\(101010110_2\)</span>. You can compare your solution with the solution below.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" height="320" name="= 100 + + 10 + 10 + 0, копия, копия.gif" src="https://ucarecdn.com/cce434cd-f737-45c0-9fd1-090d0124fe59/" width="569"/></p>
<p>Now you've learned how to add binary numbers!</p>
<h5 id="binary-subtraction">Binary subtraction</h5>
<p>Let's figure out how to subtract binary numbers manually without using a calculator or software. First, how would you subtract two large decimal numbers? Most likely, you would write them one below the other and subtract bit by bit, starting from the last digit. This method is usually called column subtraction. If you know this method, then good news for you, you can use it for binary numbers as well. </p>
<p>Surely, an example will help to understand how manual binary subtraction works. Let's subtract <span class="math-tex">\({111010_2}\)</span> from <span class="math-tex">\({ 11010110_2}\)</span>. Here, the number 214 is represented in binary as <span class="math-tex">\({ 11010110_2}\)</span> and the number 58 is represented as <span class="math-tex">\({111010_2}\)</span>.</p>
<p><u>1. Preparation</u></p>
<p>You need to determine which of the two numbers is the largest. The largest number is called the minuend, and we write it first. The smaller number is called the subtrahend, and we write it under the minuend with right alignment. Then we draw a line under the subtrahend, and below it we will write the answer to the expression.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" height="233" name="1.jpg" src="https://ucarecdn.com/e5466845-2602-416e-a516-80409911a818/" width="392"/></p>
<p><u>2. Calculations</u></p>
<p>Start subtracting from the right. We need to subtract the digits of the numbers, moving from the lowest place value to the highest. To do this, follow the binary subtraction rules to subtract the numbers:</p>
<p><span class="math-tex">\({0-0 =0} \\ {1 - 1= 0} \\ {1 -0 =1} \\ {10_2 -1 = 1}\)</span></p>
<p>Back to the example: let 's try to calculate the expression <span class="math-tex">\({ 11010110_2 - 111010_2}\)</span>. In both the minuend and the subtrahend numbers, the digit 0 is in the lower place. So the first step is to subtract (0 - 0), which is equal to 0. Similarly, we move on to the next higher order digit and subtract (1 - 1), which is 0. In the next step, we have to subtract (1 - 0), which is 1.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" height="244" name="2.jpg" src="https://ucarecdn.com/2d088161-e589-4cfd-ae4c-1f665e2fa5e0/" width="909"/></p>
<p>Now the expression (0 - 1) is in the queue, but how to subtract from 0? What do we do in this case while subtracting decimal numbers? You may remember that we need to borrow 1 from the next digit in order, which in decimal would mean subtracting the required digit from 10 instead of 0. For example, if we subtract 3 from 120 by the column method, we have to borrow 1 from 2. We subtract 3 from 10 instead of 0 and get 7 in the first place of the resulting number. Therefore, the result of subtracting (120 - 3) is 117. Why does it work? Let's transform <span class="math-tex">\(120 -3\)</span> into the sum <span class="math-tex">\({(100) + (10 + 10) + (0 - 3)}\)</span>. When we borrow 1 from 2, in fact, we take 10 from the second bracket and move it into the bracket with the number 3. After borrowing, we get <span class="math-tex">\({(100) + (10) + ( 10 - 3)}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Below you can watch the animation illustrating the principle of borrowing in detail. For simplicity, when we borrow, we will write -1 on top of the next digit, which means we need to subtract 1 from this digit. </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" height="245" name="4.jpg" src="https://ucarecdn.com/0e1231a8-d0d1-4e18-b47c-c2370a4622b8/" width="214"/></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" height="259" name="100 + + 10 + 10 + 0.gif" src="https://ucarecdn.com/96a693a8-e12c-4def-81dc-f2e2dce32bbc/" width="460"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>As you can see, place values of any neighboring digits differ by 10 times. Therefore, you can borrow at any stage of the calculations. Everything is the same in the case of binary numbers. We need to borrow 1 from the next digit and subtract from 10. Do not forget that 10 in the binary system of calculus is equal to 2. But the algorithm remains exactly the same. You can see this for yourself with the example of <span class="math-tex">\({110_2 -1}\)</span>. </p>
<p> </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" height="283" name="= 100 + + 10 + 10 + 0, копия.gif" src="https://ucarecdn.com/29fafc95-539f-4e93-a98c-310b65a0be81/" width="503"/></p>
<p>And now, let's go back to our main expression: at this stage, we need to subtract 1 from 0. Recall that we subtract <span class="math-tex">\({111010_2}\)</span> from <span class="math-tex">\({11010110_2}\)</span> and have already calculated 3 digits of the answer. After borrowing, we subtract <span class="math-tex">\({(10_2 - 1 )}\)</span>, which is 1. </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" height="258" name="3.jpg" src="https://ucarecdn.com/0bf03456-38f2-4049-bcb5-3b9a2f87fc16/" width="371"/></p>
<p>In the next step, we have to subtract 1 from 0, due to past borrowing <span class="math-tex">\({(1 -1) = 0}\)</span>. This means we need to borrow 1 from the next digit again. Therefore, we get <span class="math-tex">\({(1-1)+10_2 -1 = 1}\)</span>. </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" height="287" name="5.jpg" src="https://ucarecdn.com/0c0a7391-e4c1-4b20-8b1e-046565ee0cc6/" width="401"/></p>
<p>The next higher order digit has (0 - 1), for which we need to borrow 1. Do not forget that we borrowed at the last stage, too, and we need to subtract 1. Hence, we get (10 - 1) -1 = 0.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" height="271" name="6.jpg" src="https://ucarecdn.com/bd94afbd-5a23-4b15-8738-17d788e2d87c/" width="407"/></p>
<p>There are no digits left in the subtrahend. Therefore, we assume that 0 is subtracted from all other digits of the minuend. We borrowed from 1, so <span class="math-tex">\({(1- 1) -0 = 0}\)</span>. Next, <span class="math-tex">\({1-0 =1}\)</span>. </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" height="263" name="7.jpg" src="https://ucarecdn.com/2f0a3e6c-4d48-4436-9637-ba185a749831/" width="743"/></p>
<p>We have received the answer <span class="math-tex">\({10011100_2}\)</span>. Let's check it. The decimal equivalent of <span class="math-tex">\({11010110_2}\)</span> is 214 and the decimal equivalent of <span class="math-tex">\({111010_2}\)</span> is 58. Therefore, the result is 156. The binary equivalent of 156 is <span class="math-tex">\({10011100_2}\)</span>. Look at us! </p>
<p>Finally, let's look at an expression <span class="math-tex">\({ 10000_2 -1}\)</span>. What is it equal to? At each step, you need to borrow. </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" height="273" name="8.jpg" src="https://ucarecdn.com/b6b0a663-0360-4b58-8214-d5b02ab8397e/" width="318"/></p>
<p>The answer is <span class="math-tex">\({1111_2}\)</span>. </p>
<p>Now you know how to subtract binary numbers!</p>
<h5 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h5>
<p>Addition and subtraction of binary numbers are performed similarly to addition and subtraction of decimal numbers, using the column addition method. You need to write the numbers in a column. Next, start the calculations from unit places. Follow the rules of addition and subtraction to calculate each digit of the resulting number. Pay particular attention to the carry rule for addition and the borrow rule for subtraction. Applying the column method step by step, you will get the answer.</p>
