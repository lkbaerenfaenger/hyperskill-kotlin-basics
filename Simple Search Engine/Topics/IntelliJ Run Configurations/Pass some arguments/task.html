<h2>Pass some arguments</h2>
<p>Imagine you have a program reading the content of text files and writing it into the console. It accepts the file names via command-line arguments.</p>
<p>What would be the arguments passed to the program in case you need to output the content of files <strong>example.txt</strong> and <strong>implementation.txt</strong> lying in the program root folder, and the <strong>example.txt</strong> file content should go first?</p>
