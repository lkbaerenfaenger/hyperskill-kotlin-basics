<h2>Size and capacity</h2>
<p>Assume that for a dynamic array of size <span class="math-tex">\(2\)</span> and capacity <span class="math-tex">\(4\)</span> we perform the following sequence of operations:</p>
<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">add 7
add 1
add 3
insert 4 3
add 6
add 7
add 8</code></pre>
<p>Here "add x" means "add an element x to the end of the array" and "insert x i" means "add an element x at the specified index i".</p>
<p>Once all operations are performed, what will be the difference between the capacity of the new array (new_capacity) and its size (new_size)? Print this number, i.e. <code class="java">new_capacity - new_size</code> in the field below. </p>
<p>Assume that the scaling factor for the array is $2$. Also note that every time you increase the array's capacity, it becomes twice as big as the capacity of the array at the previous step, rather than the initial array's capacity.</p>
