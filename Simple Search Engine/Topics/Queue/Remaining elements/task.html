<h2>Remaining elements</h2>
<p>Suppose you have an empty queue. There is a sequence of operations to be performed:</p>

<pre><code class="java">enqueue 10
enqueue 20
dequeue
enqueue 30
enqueue 20
dequeue</code></pre>

<p>Which items will remain in the queue (starting with the first one to be dequeued)?</p>
