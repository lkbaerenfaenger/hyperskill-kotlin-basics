<h2>Modulo division</h2>
<html><body><p>There are four well-known basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The last one is probably the most confusing for most people. In this lesson, we'll refresh your knowledge about division and also talk about its "modification" for positive numbers – modulo division.</p>
<h5 id="basic-division-and-division-with-remainder" style="text-align: center;">Basic division and division with remainder</h5>
<p>Let's look at the two examples below and try to explain the difference between them:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span class="math-tex">\[\underbrace{6}_{\text{dividend}} ~/~ \underbrace{2}_{\text{divisor}} = \underbrace{3}_{\text{quotient}} ~~~~~~~~~~ \text{v}\bigg|\text{s} ~~~~~~~~~~ \underbrace{7}_{\text{dividend}} ~/~ \underbrace{2}_{\text{divisor}} = \underbrace{3.5}_{\text{quotient}}\]</span></p>
<p>Attentive readers may notice that in the left equation above the result of the division is an integer when in the right one it is not a natural number. That happens because <span class="math-tex">\(6\)</span> is a multiple of <span class="math-tex">\(2\)</span>, while <span class="math-tex">\(7\)</span> is not. Such examples are called the <strong>non-integer</strong> division (in programming languages, it is usually known as <strong>float division</strong>), despite the result could be either integer or real. At an elementary level, the division result (speaking about natural numbers) is the number of times one number is contained within another one. In the previous example, we can see that number six contains number two exactly three times. The fractional part in the second case occurs because number <span class="math-tex">\(7\)</span> could not be represented as an exact sum of twos:</p>
<p><span class="math-tex">\[6 = \underbrace{2+2+2}_{\text{3 times}} ~~~~~~~~~~ \text{v}\bigg|\text{s} ~~~~~~~~~~ 7 = \underbrace{2+2+2}_{\text{3 times}} + 1\]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span class="math-tex">\(\text{or}\)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span class="math-tex">\[~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\underbrace{6}_{\text{dividend}} = \underbrace{3}_{\text{quotient}} \times \underbrace{2}_{\text{divisor}} + ~0 ~~~~~~~~~~ \text{v}\bigg|\text{s} ~~~~~~~~~~\underbrace{7}_{\text{dividend}} = \underbrace{3}_{\text{integer part of division}} \times \underbrace{2}_{\text{divisor}} + \underbrace{1}_{\text{remainder}}\]</span></p>
<p>The last representation of number <span class="math-tex">\(7\)</span> illustrates that number <span class="math-tex">\(2\)</span> is fully contained in it three times. The last summand is called the <strong>remainder</strong>. It illustrates what remains if the maximum possible multiple of the divisor would be subtracted from the original dividend. In case when the <strong>dividend</strong> is a multiple of the <strong>divisor </strong>(the <strong>quotient </strong>is integer), the remainder equals <span class="math-tex">\(0\)</span>. The remainder is always a non-negative integer, which is strictly less than the divisor.</p>
<p>Two operators which return an integer part of the division and its remainder are <span class="math-tex">\(\operatorname{div}\)</span> and <span class="math-tex">\(\bmod\)</span> respectively. Let's demonstrate how they work using an example with <span class="math-tex">\(7\)</span>:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span class="math-tex">\(6\operatorname{div}2 = 3 ~~~~~~~~~~ \text{v}\bigg|\text{s} ~~~~~~~~~~ 7\operatorname{div}2 = 3\)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span class="math-tex">\(6\mod2 = 0 ~~~~~~~~~~ \text{v}\bigg|\text{s} ~~~~~~~~~~ 7\mod2 = 1\)</span></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> <span class="math-tex">\(\operatorname{div}\)</span> and <span class="math-tex">\(\bmod\)</span> operators are identical to the integer part of quotient and remainder relatively only for positive operands. If one of the operands is negative, <span class="math-tex">\(\operatorname{div}\)</span> and <span class="math-tex">\(\bmod\)</span> operators work in another way. This is beyond the scope of this post, but interested readers can find more information by themselves. That is why we will work with <strong>positive numbers only</strong>. </p>
<h5 id="modulo-division" style="text-align: center;">Modulo division</h5>
<p>So let's go into details of how the <span class="math-tex">\(\bmod\)</span> operator works. </p>
<p>Assume that we have a number <span class="math-tex">\(x=n⋅y+z\)</span>, and <span class="math-tex">\(0 \leq z &lt; y\)</span>. Then</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span class="math-tex">\(x\mod y=z\)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">(read as "<strong>x modulo y is equal to z</strong>")</p>
<p>In case when <span class="math-tex">\(x &lt; y\)</span>:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span class="math-tex">\(x\mod y=x\)</span></p>
<p>With the assistance of a <span class="math-tex">\(\bmod\)</span> operator, we could check whether one number is divisible by another:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span class="math-tex">\(x\)</span> is divisible by <span class="math-tex">\(y\)</span> if and only if <span class="math-tex">\(x\mod y = 0\)</span></strong></p>
<p>i.e. <strong>x modulo y is equal to 0</strong>.</p>
<p>In the majority of programming languages the <span class="math-tex">\(\bmod\)</span> operator is written as %, i.e. <span class="math-tex">\(x\mod y\)</span> would be written as <span class="math-tex">\(x\)</span> % <span class="math-tex">\(y\)</span>.</p>
<h5 id="examples" style="text-align: center;">Examples</h5>
<p>Now let's consider several cases to grasp what we have learned.</p>
<p><strong>1. Even or not</strong></p>
<p>For instance, you have a task to check if the number <span class="math-tex">\(x\)</span> is even or not. It is extremely simple using the <span class="math-tex">\(\bmod\)</span> operator. You know that a number is even if it is divisible by <span class="math-tex">\(2\)</span>. So, a given number <span class="math-tex">\(x\)</span> is even if and only if <span class="math-tex">\(x\)</span> modulo <span class="math-tex">\(2\)</span> equals <span class="math-tex">\(0\)</span>, i.e.:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span class="math-tex">\(x\mod2=0\)</span></p>
<p>And this means that in your code you just need to check if the condition <span class="math-tex">\(x\)</span> % <span class="math-tex">\(2\)</span> == <span class="math-tex">\(0\)</span> is met.</p>
<p><strong>2. What time is it now?</strong></p>
<p>As you know, in the world there are two widespread time conventions: <span class="math-tex">\(12\)</span>-hour clock and <span class="math-tex">\(24\)</span>-hour clock. Imagine that you have a friend in Russia who uses the <span class="math-tex">\(24\)</span>-hour clock and you ask him what time is it now in his city. He answered you, but, unfortunately, you live according to the <span class="math-tex">\(12\)</span>-hour one and don't understand what time is there exactly. However, this problem could be solved with the program code and the assistance of the <span class="math-tex">\(\bmod\)</span> operator.</p>
<p>Assume that your friend said that it is <span class="math-tex">\(16\)</span> o'clock at the moment. How to transfer it to the <span class="math-tex">\(12\)</span>-hour clock? No problem! Just think, what is a <span class="math-tex">\(24\)</span>-hour clock: people who use it just consider the full day as two full turns of the clock. Same as you, but instead of using a.m. or p.m. they numerate times continuously from <span class="math-tex">\(00:00\)</span> to <span class="math-tex">\(23:59\)</span>. And the secret of conversion is taking time in <span class="math-tex">\(24\)</span>-hour format modulo <span class="math-tex">\(12\)</span>.</p>
<p>Your friend said that it was <span class="math-tex">\(16\)</span> o'clock at the moment. Let's convert it to <span class="math-tex">\(12\)</span>-hour format:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span class="math-tex">\(16\mod12=4\)</span> because <span class="math-tex">\(16 = 1\cdot12 + 4\)</span></p>
<p>And since <span class="math-tex">\(16\operatorname{div}12=1\)</span>, <span class="math-tex">\(16\)</span> o'clock is equal to <span class="math-tex">\(4\)</span> p.m.</p>
<h5 id="is-it-useful" style="text-align: center;">Is it useful?</h5>
<p>The functionality of the <strong>mod </strong>operator is very simple when you understand it. However, if it is the first time you faced it, some troubles could arise. And the reasonable question is "Is it really useful?". The answer is "Absolutely, yes!".</p>
<p>One of the most significant examples of usage of the <strong>mod </strong>operator is cryptography. In this area, programmers need to have a function, which is difficult to calculate the original value from, knowing its result. For instance, hackers have known that result of <span class="math-tex">\(x\)</span> modulo <span class="math-tex">\(25\)</span> is equal to <span class="math-tex">\(3\)</span>. And they would like to know what is <span class="math-tex">\(x\)</span>. It is a very hard task, because any number, that looks like <span class="math-tex">\(x=n\cdot25+3\)</span>, where <span class="math-tex">\(n\)</span> is an arbitrary natural number, gives you <span class="math-tex">\(x\mod25=3\)</span>. There are millions of possible values of <span class="math-tex">\(x\)</span>. Sure, encryption algorithms are much more complicated than just taking the remainder from the division. But the idea of using it is very important.</p>
<p>It is also used when you need to operate with extremely big numbers and your resources are restricted. Applying mathematical basic operators (<span class="math-tex">\(+\)</span>, <span class="math-tex">\(-\)</span>, <span class="math-tex">\(\times\)</span>, <span class="math-tex">\(\div\)</span>) not to the big number itself, but to its remainder makes your computation thousands of times easier and allows you to make conclusions faster. It is not possible in every case, but sometimes it helps a lot.</p></body></html>
