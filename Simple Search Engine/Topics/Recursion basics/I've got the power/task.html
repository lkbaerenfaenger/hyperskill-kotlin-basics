<h2>I've got the power</h2>
<p>Here is the draft of the recursive function that finds out whether the positive number is a power of 2. For example, 64 is a power of 2, but 12 is not.</p>

<p>Is <em>X </em>a<em> </em>power of 2:</p>

<ul>
	<li>If <em>X</em> = 1, the result is YES</li>
	<li>If <em>X</em> &gt; 1 and <em>X</em> &lt; 2, the result is NO</li>
	<li>If <em>X</em> &gt;= 2, see: "Is <em>X / 2</em> (<strong>floating point division</strong>) a power of 2"</li>
</ul>

<p>How many times will we make the reduction step (i.e. will the <u>function call itself</u>) for X = 10?</p>
