<h2>The factorial</h2>
<p>You are trying to explain recursion to your friend and tell them about a factorial of a positive integer. You are writing the following:</p>

<p><em>factorial</em> (X) :</p>

<ul>
	<li>If <em>X</em> is 1, factorial is 1.</li>
	<li>If <em>X</em> is not 1, see: <span class="math-tex">\(factorial(X-1) * X.\)</span></li>
</ul>

<p>Is the algorithm correct?</p>
