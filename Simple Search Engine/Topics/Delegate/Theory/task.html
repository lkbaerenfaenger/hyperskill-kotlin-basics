<h2>Delegate</h2>
<p>Most programming involves reusing already existing code, sometimes with a few changes. In object-oriented programming (which is the case of Kotlin), for example, the main tool for code reusage is inheritance (and composition, consequently), which we've already covered. In this topic, we will discuss an alternative to inheritance – <strong>delegation</strong>. </p>
<h5 id="syntax-of-delegate">Syntax of delegate</h5>
<p>Delegation is a process of using a certain object instead of providing implementation, and we're going to take a look at how exactly it works.</p>
<p>Suppose we have fairly simple code – an interface and it's implementation:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">interface MyInterface {
    fun print()
    val msg: String
}

class MyImplementation : MyInterface {
    override fun print() {
        println(msg)
    }

    override val msg: String = "MyImplementation sends regards!"
}
</code></pre>
<p>Nothing new here: the interface declares a property and a function, and the class implements those.</p>
<p>Now, suppose that we need to create a new class, which would 1) have some functionality of its own, and 2) would implement the given interface at the same time. We'd stumble upon copy-pasting the code: we already have an implementation of this interface, but we need a different class, which, however, would still need to implement this interface.</p>
<p>That's where the delegate comes into play: it turns out that we can happily code our new class, and when we need to use the implementation of the interface, we just reference the already existing implementation, and Kotlin does the rest. Like so:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">class MyNewClass(base: MyInterface) : MyInterface by base {  
    override val msg = "Delegate sends regards."  
}</code></pre>
<p>Alright, but what are those "by" and "base" in this context? Let's take a closer look.</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">class MyNewClass(  
        base: MyInterface) 
        // ^ Here we expect an implementation of MyInterface as a parameter (named "base")  
        : MyInterface by base { 
        // ^ And here we state that MyInterface is implemented by the previously obtained parameter, the one named "base"  
    override val msg = "Delegate sends regards."  
}</code></pre>
<p>Essentially, in the constructor of this class, we require something that implements the interface <code class="language-kotlin">MyInterface</code> marked by a semi-colon (<code class="language-kotlin">:</code>), and then, using the keyword <code class="language-kotlin">by</code>, we tell the derived class that whenever it is asked to perform anything "promised" by the <code class="language-kotlin">MyInterface</code> interface, it will use the provided object to do so. </p>
<p>The code looks like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">// We create an instance of class, implementing MyInterface
val a = MyImplementation()  

// Then we pass this implementation instance as a parameter
val delegate = MyNewClass(a)  
println(delegate.msg)
</code></pre>
<p>It will print:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">Delegate sends regards.
</code></pre>
<h5 id="solving-complications-by-overriding">Solving complications by overriding</h5>
<p>However, what exactly will this code do?</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">val a = MyImplementation()
val delegate = MyNewClass(a)

delegate.print()</code></pre>
<p>Notice that in the previous example, we accessed the property of the delegate, which the delegate specifically overrides. Now that we access the method we don't override in the delegate, what do you think the code will print?</p>
<p>Take some time to muse on the answer, then keep reading.</p>
<p>This code will print the following line:</p>
<p><code class="language-kotlin">MyImplementation sends regards!</code></p>
<p>Let's look at our class with delegation again:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">class MyNewClass(base: MyInterface) : MyInterface by base {  
    override val msg = "Delegate sends regards."  
}
</code></pre>
<p>It doesn't have any methods named <code class="language-kotlin">print</code>. But it does have the <code class="language-kotlin">base</code> instance, which is an implementation of <code class="language-kotlin">MyInterface</code>, which does have the <code class="language-kotlin">print()</code> function, and that function is called when we write <code class="language-kotlin">delegate.print()</code>. So, the class <code class="language-kotlin">MyNewClass</code> just <strong>delegates</strong> this task to <code class="language-kotlin">MyImplementation</code>. This class contains a non-overridden <code class="language-kotlin">msg</code>, which reads <code class="language-kotlin">MyImplementation sends regards!</code>, so the code just prints <code class="language-kotlin">MyImplementation sends regards!</code> to the console.</p>
<p>When you use delegation, be careful to draw a line between the overridden properties/methods of the delegate and the ones which will use only the base implementation and its data.</p>
<h5 id="callback-and-logger-example">Callback and Logger example</h5>
<p>In the example above, we mainly used delegate to override some properties set by the interface and do something simple. Let's take a look at a more complex case featuring not one but two delegates!</p>
<p></p><div class="alert alert-warning"> This example is twice as complicated as what we've had before, so no worries if it looks unclear – once you develop a better intuitive feeling for the structure of delegate, it will make more sense. </div>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">// First interface, specifies contract for callbacks
interface ICallbackReceiver {
    fun onBeforeAction()
    fun onAfterAction()
    fun action(function: () -&gt; Unit) {
        onBeforeAction();
        function()
        onAfterAction()
    }
}

// Second interface, specifies contract for logger
interface ILogger {
    fun getStubDateTime() = "05.11.2022-14:31:04" // stub

    val format: String
        get() = "[${getStubDateTime()}]: "

    fun print(s: String)
}

// Simple implementation of ILogger interface
class BasicLogger : ILogger {
    override fun print(s: String) = println(format + s)
}

// Implementation of first interface, which defines callback actions,
// setting them to simply print to console each time they are called.
// However! For printing, it utilizes delegated BasicLogger, which
// in this example prints info with date and time markers.
class ConsoleNotifier(logger: ILogger) : ICallbackReceiver, ILogger by logger {
    val onBeforeStr = "OnBefore!"
    val onAfterStr = "OnAfter!"

    // "print" is delegated to "logger"
    override fun onBeforeAction() = print(onBeforeStr)
    override fun onAfterAction() = print(onAfterStr)
}</code></pre>
<p>Above, two interfaces with two corresponding implementations are introduced. </p>
<p>The first one, <code class="language-kotlin">ICallbackReceiver</code>, can be used in the case when we need to "surround" a certain action with function calls doing something before and after the execution of a function. Such an approach is often used in what is known as <strong>serialization</strong> – the process of saving data structure as a file. For example, when we save files, we can prepare the needed data in <code class="language-kotlin">onBeforeAction</code>, and when we load it, we can construct the data back in <code class="language-kotlin">onAfterAction</code>.</p>
<p>The second one, <code class="language-kotlin">ILogger</code>, is simply a formatter for output. However, when used as a delegate, it makes all output follow the same pattern, which can be useful for logging.</p>
<p><code class="language-kotlin">ConsoleNotifier</code>, the implementation of <code class="language-kotlin">ICallbackReceiver</code>, uses it as a delegate instead of the usual <code class="language-kotlin">println()</code>.</p>
<p>Below, we construct a class which implements both interfaces via delegation. The implementation of <code class="language-kotlin">ILogger</code> is used twice – in the inner structure of <code class="language-kotlin">notifier</code> and in the class itself.</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">// Class implementing both interfaces by delegation to implementation to above classes
class ExampleParser(notifier: ICallbackReceiver, logger: BasicLogger) : ICallbackReceiver by notifier, ILogger by logger {
    fun start() = action { parseFiles() }

    fun parseFiles() {
        print("Parsing...");
        // do some file parsing
    }
}

fun main() {
    val loggerInstance = BasicLogger()
    val dateTimeNotifier = ConsoleNotifier(loggerInstance)

    val simpleParser = ExampleParser(dateTimeNotifier, loggerInstance)
    simpleParser.start()
}</code></pre>
<p>If we run the code above – here's the result. The first delegate makes a function call before and after the action, and the second delegate formats the output.</p>
<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">[05.11.2022-14:31:04]: OnBefore!
[05.11.2022-14:31:04]: Parsing...
[05.11.2022-14:31:04]: OnAfter!</code></pre>
<h5 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h5>
<p>Delegation allows for a better code reusage, or rather makes it more convenient due to Kotlin's good language-level support of delegation. Instead of writing code to achieve certain functionality inside the class (potentially copying this code from already existing implementations), we can introduce an object that already has the functionality we need and use this object to get the desirable result. </p>
