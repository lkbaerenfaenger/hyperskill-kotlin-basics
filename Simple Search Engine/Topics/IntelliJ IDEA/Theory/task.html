<h2>IntelliJ IDEA</h2>
<html><body><h5 id="intellij-idea" style="text-align: center;">IntelliJ IDEA</h5>
<p>IntelliJ IDEA is an intelligent, context-aware IDE for working with Java and other JVM languages like Kotlin, Scala, and Groovy on all sorts of applications. It has an ergonomic user interface, supports a lot of plugins, and provides a very powerful automatic code completion feature. IntelliJ IDEA has three editions: community, enterprise, and educational. All editions support multiple programming languages, including Java, Kotlin, Scala, and some others. The educational edition has a convenient functionality for downloading programming problems from the Hyperskill platform and checking your solutions directly from the IDEA. However, the community edition is enough to complete any project.</p>

<h5 id="creating-the-first-project-in-intellij-idea" style="text-align: center;">Creating the first project in IntelliJ IDEA</h5>
<p>Let's write some text using IntelliJ IDEA. Here we assume that you have the community edition already installed on your computer. The other editions have minor differences in the interface.</p>
<p>1. If no project is currently open in IntelliJ IDEA, click <strong>Create New Project </strong>on the Welcome screen. Otherwise, select <strong>File | New | Project</strong>. As a result, the <strong>New Project</strong> wizard opens.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" height="383" src="https://ucarecdn.com/7889afb5-924c-4a49-821c-45dca8bb232e/" width="646"/></p>
<p>The color scheme of your window may be different. Later, in the <strong>IDEA Settings </strong>paragraph, is a description of how to change it.</p>
<p>2. In the panel on the left, select your language (for example, Java or Kotlin). There is also an option to create an empty project without any language support:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" src="https://ucarecdn.com/1ac15a4c-1832-4f5e-af9d-73a4af3ee83f/"/></p>
<p>You may see additional options, like the JDK (Java Development Kit), that you may want to modify for your project. Just leave them unchanged for now.</p>
<p>3. The next pages may propose different templates. Code templates are prewritten snippets of code provided by the IDE. Now we are going to study the very basics of IntelliJ IDEA, and do everything from scratch, so we aren't selecting any of the options. Just leave the default.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" src="https://ucarecdn.com/841e12fc-4013-4250-953c-4ec0e6e4d902/"/></p>
<p>4. On the final page, specify the project name (e.g. <code class="java">HelloWorld</code>). If necessary, you can change the project location on disk, but you can also use one suggested by IntelliJ IDEA.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" src="https://ucarecdn.com/cbaae9c0-e696-4033-89de-3e9eb069ee0b/"/></p>
<p>5. Click <strong>Finish</strong>.</p>
<p>Wait while IntelliJ IDEA creates the project. When this process is complete, the structure of your new project is shown in the <strong>Project</strong> tool window.</p>
<p>Let's take a look at the project structure on the left side of the window.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" src="https://ucarecdn.com/e9f47471-674c-401c-8e07-92c99a7dde70/"/></p>
<p>There are two top-level nodes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>HelloWorld</strong>. This node represents your project module. The <code class="java">.idea</code> folder and the file <code class="java">HelloWorld.iml</code> are used to store configuration data for your project and module respectively. The folder <code class="java">src</code> is for your source code.</li>
<li><strong>External Libraries</strong>. This is a category that represents all the "external" resources necessary for your development work. The standard files of your project language are placed there. Also, you can add other resources manually.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="writing" style="text-align: center;">Writing</h5>
<p>Now we are going to write a text for the Hello World project.</p>
<p>1. In the Project tool window, select the <code class="java">src</code> folder and select <strong>File | New</strong>, or right-click the folder <code class="java">src</code> and select <strong>New</strong> from the context menu.</p>
<p>2. In the New menu, select <strong>File</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" src="https://ucarecdn.com/cce89d59-a49d-432f-b3df-b6566d01f276/"/></p>
<p>3. In the <strong>New File</strong> dialog that opens, type <code class="java">text.txt</code> in the text field. Press<strong> Enter</strong> to create the file.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" src="https://ucarecdn.com/c1cc0feb-55cf-46ba-8658-e59a369a951b/"/></p>
<p>Now, you can see this file in the <code class="java">src</code> folder. At the same time, the file opens in the editor. So, we've just created a text file and in the future, you can use the same way to create source code files for your language.</p>
<p>We are to create something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">This is my test text file in IDEA.

Or is there a mistacke?
</code></pre>
<p>But do not rush! Let's do it gradually, step by step.</p>
<p>As you see, there is a typo. And our IDE warns us about it:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" src="https://ucarecdn.com/158c0fa3-791f-4bac-bc1a-d76e0f999d2f/"/></p>
<p>There are many features of the IDEA. Now we want to introduce you to one called "Context actions". Place the cursor at the wrong word, press <strong>Alt+Enter</strong>, select <strong>Typo: Change to...</strong> with arrows and press <strong>Enter</strong>, and finally select the correct word from the list and press <strong>Enter</strong> again. The typo disappears :)</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" src="https://ucarecdn.com/770a8448-ed00-4d12-9ee4-e004e43bebb4/"/></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" src="https://ucarecdn.com/93b2152e-1126-448e-b95a-a3920e31c539/"/></p>
<p>IDEA supports other context actions for code, give it a try.</p>
<p>Congratulations! You have written your probably first text in IntelliJ IDEA and understood that there is a hidden power. You can always refer to the more complete <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/creating-and-running-your-first-java-application.html#create_project" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">official tutorial</a>. We especially recommend reading about <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/using-file-and-code-templates.html" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">templates</a> and <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/auto-completing-code.html" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">code completion</a>.</p>
<h5 id="idea-settings" style="text-align: center;">IDEA Settings</h5>
<p>IntelliJ IDEA has a lot of settings that can be configured as you wish. Go to <strong>File | Settings</strong>. There are many sections in the open <strong>Settings</strong> tab.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" src="https://ucarecdn.com/40d5aa54-17a8-4732-814f-3f0bfff6046e/"/></p>
<p>As an example, please go to <strong>Appearance &amp; Behavior | Appearance</strong> and choose different themes. In this lesson, we use <strong>Darcula</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" src="https://ucarecdn.com/b3400f88-fcfa-4bb9-834f-ba424f108161/"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p></p><div class="alert alert-primary"><strong>Note:</strong> If you would like to find something in the settings, use the search box as shown below.</div>
<p> </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" src="https://ucarecdn.com/a9b21fc5-be9f-4dbd-894a-7a3d2a74a73d/"/></p>
<h5 id="how-to-start-my-program" style="text-align: center;">How to start my program?</h5>
<p>Of course, you can create and run your programs in IDEA. Just create a new language-specific file, write content, find the green triangle "run" button ( <img alt="" src="https://ucarecdn.com/fd073dc5-ef21-4698-9d4a-6be5f748cf5b/"/> ), and click it.</p>
<p>Sometimes, your program cannot be started from IDEA for various reasons.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Make sure your program contains the <code class="java">main</code> method. If not, then add it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The source code should be placed inside the <code class="java">src</code> directory, not next to it.</p>
</li>
<li>Sometimes no JDK is selected. To fix this, go to <strong>File | Project Structure | Project settings | Project </strong>and then set your JDK in the <strong>Project SDK</strong> section.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" height="151" src="https://ucarecdn.com/ebffd8a3-d2a2-4a65-a349-85c78d63eb4b/" width="685"/></p>
<p>If you have another problem, please write it in the comments or Google it.</p>
<h5 id="conclusion" style="text-align: center;">Conclusion</h5>
<p>IntelliJ IDEA is one of the best IDEs for Java and JVM languages. It allows programmers to easily work and code while having convenient access to all of its functions. Features like automatic code completion and ergonomic UI make the working experience quite pleasant.</p></body></html>
