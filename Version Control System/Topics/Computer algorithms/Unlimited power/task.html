<p>C-3PO is a robot who lives in a rectangular maze, as shown in the picture. C-3PO can move up, down, left, and right; and its movement is restricted by the walls (the bold lines in the maze).</p>

<p>As we know, C-3PO is controlled algorithmically, hence, we give to it the following algorithm:</p>
<pre><code class="java">WHILE right is free

    go right 

WHILE wall is in the right and bottom is free

    go down

IF ROBOT is in cell F6 

    stop</code></pre>
<p>Starting from cell <strong>A1</strong>, does C-3PO reach the orange box <strong>F6</strong> after performing the algorithm? If yes, write the number of cells crossed by C-3PO. Otherwise, write 0. Note that the first and the last cells also count.</p></body></html>
