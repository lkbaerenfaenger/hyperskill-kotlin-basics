<h2>Hashing an array</h2>
<p>Consider the following hash function for an array of integers:</p>

<ul>
	<li>if the array has at least 5 elements, pick 5 of them at random and return their sum as their hash value</li>
	<li>if there are fewer than 5, return the sum of all elements.</li>
</ul>

<p>Select all the reasons why this is not a good hash function:</p>
